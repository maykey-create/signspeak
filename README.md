🖐️📹 SignSpeaks – Real-Time Communication Aid
🌟 Overview

SignSpeaks is a web-based accessibility tool designed for people who cannot speak.
The app uses the user’s camera to capture hand signs (sign language) and mouth movements (lip reading), then converts them into real-time text captions.

It runs in the browser and works alongside popular video conferencing apps like Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Duo – helping users communicate seamlessly during live calls.

✨ Key Features

🎥 Camera-based Recognition – Uses computer vision + AI to detect hand signs and mouth movements.

⌨️ Live Text Conversion – Converts sign language and lip movements into text in real time.

💬 Caption Overlay – Displays generated text as captions during ongoing calls.

🌐 Cross-Platform – Works with Google Meet, Zoom, Duo, Teams, and more (via browser overlay).

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Accessibility First – Focused on mute or speech-impaired users.

🔊 Optional Speech Output – Converts recognized text into synthetic speech for participants in the call.

🖥️ Browser-Based – No installation required, runs with just a camera + internet.

🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)

Frontend: React / Next.js, TailwindCSS for UI.

Computer Vision: TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe (hand tracking, face + lip reading).

AI Models: Pretrained sign language + lip reading models (fine-tuned).

Text-to-Speech (Optional): Web Speech API or third-party APIs.

Real-time Processing: WebAssembly + WebRTC for low-latency capture.

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify for web hosting.

🚀 How It Works

User opens the SignSpeaks website in their browser.

The site requests camera permission.

AI models detect hand gestures + mouth movements.

Detected movements are converted into text.

Text is shown as live captions (and optionally spoken aloud).

The user can keep this site open alongside their video call for live communication.

📌 Future Roadmap

🌍 Support for multiple sign languages (ASL, BSL, ISL, etc.).

🤖 AI-powered grammar correction for better text accuracy.

🔗 Direct integration with Google Meet / Zoom APIs for native captions.

📱 Mobile-first version for Android/iOS.

🧩 Browser extension version for seamless integration.

🙌 Who Is This For?

Mute or speech-impaired individuals.

People who use sign language but need text communication in calls.

Teams/educators who want inclusive communication tools.
